# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs through Predictive Modeling of Congestion

## Overview

This project aims to reduce last-mile delivery expenses by 15% within six months.  We achieve this by developing a predictive model that forecasts traffic congestion and incorporates this information into route optimization strategies. The analysis involves processing historical delivery data, building a predictive model using machine learning techniques, and evaluating its performance in reducing delivery times and fuel consumption, ultimately leading to cost savings.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including metrics such as model accuracy, predicted congestion levels, and estimated cost savings.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing congestion patterns over time, route optimization comparisons) which are saved in the `output` directory.  These visualizations aid in understanding the model's predictions and their impact on delivery optimization.  The specific output files and their contents will depend on the data used and the model's performance.
